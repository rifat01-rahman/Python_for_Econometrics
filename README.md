# Python_for_Econometrics

This repository contains Python-based implementations of core econometric concepts, models, and techniques. It is designed for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to apply econometric methods using Python for empirical analysis.

## 📌 Overview

Econometrics combines statistical methods with economic theory to analyze economic data. This repository demonstrates how Python can be used as a powerful tool for:

Data analysis and visualization

Estimation of econometric models

Time series analysis

Panel data analysis

Forecasting and policy evaluation

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Descriptive Statistics and Data Handling

Simple and Multiple Linear Regression

Hypothesis Testing

Diagnostic Tests (Multicollinearity, Heteroskedasticity, Autocorrelation)

Time Series Models (AR, MA, ARIMA)

Stationarity and Unit Root Tests

Cointegration Analysis

Panel Data Models (Fixed Effects, Random Effects)

Forecasting Techniques

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

The following Python libraries are primarily used:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

statsmodels

wooldridge

linearmodels

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this repository is to provide practical, reproducible examples of econometric analysis using Python, bridging the gap between theory and real-world applications.
